### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Hakjin Lee, ML/CV research engineer @ Satrec Initiative.

My main interests lie on studying **what learning is** by insights from **learning with limited supervisions/non-stationary data**.

To investigate this topic, I have interests on a variety of fundamental topics including optimization & generalization, few-shot learning, hyperparameter optimization, meta learning, causal inference and so on.

Especially, I am focusing on problems from computer vision, which is one of the most primitive intellectual functions of the life.

### ðŸ”­ Research Interests
* Optimization & Generalization
* Few-Shot Learning
* Meta Learning
* Causal Inference

### âš¡ Especially interested in
* Learing with limited supervisions/non-stationary data in Computer Vision
* Extend ML/DL theory beyond image classification

### ðŸ¤” More specifically
* Few-Shot Learning
* Continual Learning
* Active Learning - for Object Detection or other complicated computer vision applications
* Nonparametric Methods including Gaussian Process or Kernel Methods
* Bias-variance tradeoff or Interpretation on loss surfaces.
