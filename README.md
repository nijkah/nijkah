### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Hakjin Lee, ML/CV research engineer @ Satrec Initiative.

My main interests lie on studying **what learning is** by insights from **learning with limited supervisions/non-stationary data**.

### ðŸ”­ Research Interests
* Optimization & Generalization
* Probabilistic Modeling
* Meta Learning
* Causal Inference

### âš¡ Especially interested in
* Learing with limited supervisions/non-stationary data in Computer Vision
* Extend ML/DL theory beyond image classification

### ðŸ¤” More specifically
* Few-Shot Learning
* Continual Learning
* Active Learning - for Object Detection
* Bayesian Neural Network
* Higher-order Optimization
